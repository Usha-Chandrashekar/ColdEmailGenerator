      "You're referring to Neil Armstrong!\n",
      "\n",
      "Neil Armstrong was an American astronaut, engineer, and naval aviator who became the first person to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930, in Wapakoneta, Ohio. He developed an interest in flight at a young age and earned his pilot's license at 15. He studied aeronautical engineering at Purdue University and later served in the United States Navy as a naval aviator during the Korean War.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1962, Armstrong was selected as an astronaut by NASA, and he flew on the Gemini 8 mission in 1966. Three years later, he was chosen to command the Apollo 11 mission, which aimed to land humans on the Moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 16, 1969, Armstrong, along with Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin and Michael Collins, launched into space aboard the Saturn V rocket. After traveling through space for four days, the Apollo 11 spacecraft entered into lunar orbit. On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin suited up in their spacesuits and climbed into the lunar module Eagle, which separated from the command module Columbia.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 20:17 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), the Eagle landed on the Moon's surface in the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong radioed back to Mission Control on Earth, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At 02:56 UTC on July 21, Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the Moon. He famously declared, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Aldrin joined him on the surface shortly afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong and Aldrin spent about two and a half hours on the Moon's surface, collecting samples and conducting experiments. They then returned to the Eagle and lifted off from the Moon at 23:54 UTC on July 21. The spacecraft successfully docked with Columbia, and the astronauts returned to Earth on July 24.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong's achievement was a historic milestone in space exploration, and he became an international hero and icon. He was awarded many honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neil Armstrong passed away on August 25, 2012, at the age of 82, but his legacy continues to inspire generations of scientists, engineers, and astronauts.\n"
